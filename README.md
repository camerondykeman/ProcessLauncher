#ProcessLauncher

##What is this "ProcessLauncher"?

ProcessLauncher is a Win32 Console to launch process groups serially while launching processes within a group concurrently.


##Why are you working on this?

Tasked with building this as part of a college assignment.
This isn't really my kind of fun.


##How can I get me some ProcessLauncher?

By all means:
check github.com/camerondykeman/ProcessLauncher


##But I prefer interface work...

Same.
